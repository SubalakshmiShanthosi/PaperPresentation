		\item Blind steganalysis on the discovered knowledge, suitable trained models for steganalysis can be employed and stego images will be detected with high accuracy   
		\item Using SPD, we can predict the type of steganography method from a stego image   Employing SPD can enhance the approaches, which
		assume that a special steganography method is used 
		\item The effect of SPD before applying steganalysis methods has been investigated by some steganography and steganalysis techniques and it has been validated using some image databases

			\item Wrapping :Wrap around a certain learning algorithm that can
			assess the selected feature subsets in terms of estimated classification errors and then build the final classifiers  
		\end{itemize}
		\item Fuzzy rule generation : Iterative Rule Learning approach, each individual codes one rule and in each iteration of Genetic Algorithm (GA) a new rule is adapted and added to the rule set, iteratively
